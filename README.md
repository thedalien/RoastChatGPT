# Get roasted by chatGPT

This is my first react app.

## How to use

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

2. Put your API key in the `.env.example` file.

3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

5. Run `npm start` to start the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
